# protect-route-with-jwt
The Activity Tracking project was created to learn about how to create a CRUD with React and Laravel using axios API. We'll create Projects that will be able connect with a Timer, like Todo project with a timer for each. It will have more versions which I will document too, like a JEST implementation and project optimize.

## What will be done?
We’ll learn how to protected a route by JWT authentication in react-router-dom v6. The routes will only be accessible when users have the token saved in cookies(or local storage).
